# Advanced Statistics for Genomics

- All the codes of Advance statistics labwork are uploaded here in R format. In each of the lab folder, there are .R file, .RMD file and HTML file. R and RMD files are in readable format but the HTML file needs to be downloaded to view the code as it is in R notebook format. 

- This link provides all the lectures and lab question files for future reference.

- Referred books for this course:
An introduction to R: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf

- Topics covered in the advance statistics are:
I.	Introduction – What is a probability distribution – The Uniform Distribution – The law of large numbers.
II.	 Probability estimated by relative frequency of sequence counts.  Sequence entropy.
III.	Canonical and Bayesian approaches to using the binomial distribution for inference. 
IV.	Canonical linear models and hypothesis testing.
a.	The normal distribution and the central limit theorem.
b.	The t-distribution.
c.	T-tests and their non-parametric equivalent.
d.	ANOVA.
e.	Simple linear regression.
f.	Multiple linear regression.
g.	PCA clustering in genomics experiments.
V.	Multiple hypothesis testing and the power problem in genomic studies.
VI.	Applying inference to sequence counts – the Poisson and negative binomial distributions, over-dispersion, dseq (or other rna-seq analysis packages).
VII. Mixed linear models.
